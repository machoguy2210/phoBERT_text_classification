## Introduction
This project uses the phoBERT model for text classification. The goal is to classify texts into predefined categories using data collected from the vnexpress website.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)

## Installation
The Jupyter notebook can be run on Google Colab. Follow these steps to get started:
1. Open the Colab notebook link.
2. Ensure you have a Google account to access and run the notebook.

## Data
- **Source**: Collecting from vnexpress website.
- **Description**: The dataset includes 6800 training examples and about 680 testing examples in each category.

## Usage
To use the notebook:
1. Open the `phoBERT_text_classification.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run each cell consecutively from top to bottom.
